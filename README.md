# Spam Detection Technique for IOT Devices
In this framework, five machine learning models are evaluated using various metrics with a large collection of inputs features sets. Each model computes a spam score by considering the refined input features. This score depicts the trustworthiness of IoT device under various parameters.

# Technologies Used
- **Python:** For data manipulation, analysis, and building machine learning models.
- **Pandas & NumPy:** Libraries used for data preprocessing and manipulation.
- **Scikit-learn:** ML library for implementing various algorithms such as Random Forest, SVM, etc.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization and understanding correlations.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** For iterative development and experimentation.

# Machine Learning Algorithm
- **Random Forest:** A powerful ensemble method that combines the predictions of multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting. Used for both regression and classification tasks. In this project, it helps in capturing complex relationships between environmental factors and rainfall storage.
